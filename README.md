# Project-1

An application is developed with an interface that has the options to register products and to present them using a NAVBAR. Initially, there is a form with a button that allows you to register new products and a description of the product (with fields such as; sales invoice, value, seller, taxes, among others) by pressing a button. Then, each time a new product is registered, a NAVBAR menu is updated with an option that identifies the product and when you select it 
The information registered plus a photo that makes reference to the product is presented (the image presented can be saved in the working directory). Finally, the developed application is available in HEROKU for its visualization.
